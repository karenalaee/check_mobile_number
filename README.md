This is a mobile phone number checker.

you don't need to install pip file.

how is it works?
----------------

in linux : python3 or python check_mobile_number.py

in windows : python check_mobile_number.py

when you run the code, you need to enter the phone number with country code and it's gives a 
information in one or two seconds.

then that's says to enter a number to see it is active or no, in here you don't need to enter 
country code.

and done.
